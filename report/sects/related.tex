Before jumping in the results, we need to present some other successful techniques for the facial landmark task. 3DDE~\cite{Zhu16} and CFSS~\cite{Valle19} use CNN to fit a 3D face model to the sample image. These techniques are particularly effective with unexpressive faces but fail with more extreme expressions. CNNCRF~\cite{Chen19} combines CNN and CRF. Adaloss~\cite{Teixeira19} interprets fiducial points as centers of normal distributions with fixed variance. This approach uses a different CNN and Adaloss to model these distributions. SAN-GT~\cite{Dong18} uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and CNN to generate different styles of input images. These styles are fed to a model to detect landmarks. It is believed that using several styles overcomes the difficulties that a specific style may have.
