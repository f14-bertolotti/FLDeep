\section{Abstract}\label{sect:abstract}
Facial landmark detection is the task of accurately localize fiducial points on a human face. Several important applications rely on the accuracy of models to detects these landmarks. face recognition, head pose estimation, sentiment analysis are only few of these applications. Many approaches have been proposed to address this task. Among the most promising techniques for this task are based on deep learning models. Usually, Convolutional neural network are used to either directly predict fiducial points (numbered from $1$ to $68$ in Fig.~\ref{img:sample}) or to obtain features to be input to another model. In this work, we take the latter approach. We feed features collected by a convolutional neural network to a vision transformer. We will show that such simple architecture is enough to achieve results close to the state-of-the-art.
